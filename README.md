## üìó Documentation

You will need to install Nativescript to compile code : [https://www.nativescript.org/](https://www.nativescript.org/)

Only the android build has been tested, but normally this should compile on IOS. However nativescript rebranding has not been done (logo etc.)

To install node_modules use:

```text
npm install
```

To build:

```text
tns build android
```
