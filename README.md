You will need to install Nativescript to compile code : https://www.nativescript.org/

Only the android build has been tested, but normally this should compile on IOS. However nativescript rebranding has not been done (logo etc.)

To install node_modules use
```
npm install
```

To build 
```
tns build android
```
